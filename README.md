# <Upgraded Accessibility for Online Business Webpage >

## Description

This project was created to help clean up and add semantic HTML and CSS elements to the existing online business web page code. We wanted to update the website to be more accessible for people who may have disabilities and cannot view the page normally. Updating this webpage helped me understand the importance of semantic HTML and structuring for both HTML and CSS.


## Usage

This webpage can now be accessed by screen readers and other accessibility tools due to the added semantic HTML elements and structure.
